KOrganizer/Embedded
===================

This is the embedded version of KOrganizer. It includes a replacement for the
KDE libraries called microkde, which provides the KDE specific functions
KOrganizer needs, but does not add the overhead of the complete implementation.
KOrganizer/E compiles with Qt/Embedded 2.3.2 and the corresponding QPE libs.

KOrganizer/E is based on the unaltered original KOrganizer code from the KDE CVS
HEAD branch. No changes are required. That means that all development done for
the full KDE version will also be available in the embedded version.

Some functionality of the full KDE version of Korganizer is not present in the
embedded version, because microkde is not yet complete and some functions don't
make much sense in the embedded version.

KOrganizer/E is licenced under the GPL, the microkde library is licenced under
the LGPL and the original KOrganizer code is licenced under GPL or LPGL.
